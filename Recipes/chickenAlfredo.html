  <h1>Chicken Alfredo</h1>
    <p>A delicious and hearty classic that takes approximately 45 minutes to prepare.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>16 oz. heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup parmesean cheese</li>
      <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp thyme</li>
      <li>1 tbsp diced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>16 oz. pasta of choice</li>
      <li>1 lb. chicken breast, sliced into chunks or strips</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Using a <em>wide diameter</em> saucepan (at least 7 inches), bring the heavy cream to a boil. Take care that it doesn't boil over by watching and whisking as it approaches the boil point. Reduce to a simmer and add 1 and 1/2 tbsp of butter to the cream. Set a timer for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Fill a pasta pot with water and bring to a boil. Season the chicken as you see fit. Normally we use montreal chicken seasoning.</li>
      <li>With 20 minutes left on the timer, add a 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese to the cream along with the salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, and thyme. Begin whisking the mixture every couple of minutes. Around the 18 minute mark start heating the pan for the chicken.</li>
      <li>With 15 minutes remaining, add the 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and butter to the pan and wait for it to heat before adding chicken. Cook 7-8 minutes per side. Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the packaging.</li>
      <li>With 10 minutes left on the timer, add a 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese to our alfredo sauce and whisk it in. When the pasta water is nice and starchy, add a ladle full of the water to the alfredo sauce to give it a more silky consistency.</li>
      <li>When the timers go off, combine and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
